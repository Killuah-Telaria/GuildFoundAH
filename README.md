Status Cleanup:
- initial cleanup done (expect some false items still in DB)
    - shown level is itemlevel, not character level
    - further improvements will require full itemDB build from 0
  
ToDo's:
- remove other Streamer-related options
- open up more options for group content
- check other "sell" options
- fix WoW default Money-Popup
- sometimes error with magic link on open mailbox

Maybe:
- Include GuildFound Addon content
- Options for GuildLead/Officer
- Open up "cross-guild" GuildFound (to allow sub-guilds with bank chars)
- check if trading a subset of items should still be allowed (GuildFound-related)
    - like conjured water, health stones, dungeon-items like uldaman staff
    - would 100% mean rewriting logic on guildfound trading, likely making it 50x more complex
