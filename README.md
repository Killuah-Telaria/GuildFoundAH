Status Cleanup:
- working through coded ItemDB by category
    o 10 % Weapons
    o 10 % Cloth Gear
    o 10 % Leather Gear
    o 10 % Mail Gear
    o 50 % Plate Gear
    o 95 % Consumes
    o 95 % TradeItems
    o 100 % Quivers/Bags
    o 100 % Projectiles
    o 95 % Recipes
    o 80 % Misc Items

Status Translation:
- english/spanish translations kept as is (except changed "OnlyFangs"/"GoAgain" wording to "Guildfound")
    o maybe cleanup unused item translations later
- 100% addon texts translated for deDE clients
- 90% of relevant Items translated (working on it as I clean up different item categories)
  
ToDo's:
- remove Streamer-related options / instead open up more options for group content
- check other "sell" options
- fix WoW default Money-Popup
- error with magic link on open mailbox

Maybe:
- Include GuildFound Addon content
- Options for GuildLead/Officer
- Open up "cross-guild" GuildFound (to allow sub-guilds with bank chars)
- check if trading a subset of items should still be allowed (GuildFound-related)
    o like conjured water, health stones, dungeon-items like uldaman staff
    o would 100% mean rewriting logic on guildfound trading, likely making it 50x more complex
